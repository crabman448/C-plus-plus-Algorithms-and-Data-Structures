# C-plus-plus-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures
Inspired by Swift Algorithm Club (https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-algorithm-club)

I created this repository to improve my knowledge in algorithms, data structers, problem solving and C++. If you see, that you can improve some realization then make a PR.

If you want to describe some Data Structure or algorithm feel free to make a PR too!

# Pull Request rules:
1. At least be informative in what is wrong and how to impove it :)
2. PR with solved problems would not be accepted, because for now I use this repo to store my solutions for problems, which I have solved. You can make a PR with a problem definition, which I will try to solve in my free time. In the future repo will become more open.

Have a nice day :)
